# Hybrid imaging by Leon Gobbert and Nils Bergmann

## What is the project about?

The aim of the project is to implement all functionalities to generate an hybrid image. To do so 2 given images will be filterd using high/lowpass filter befor they get combined to the hybrid image. To be sure both images align properly, the user has to click three points on both images as references for the warp transformation that matches both images on top of each other. 

## What to install?
- Python version 3.10 is required in order to run the code, type 'python --version' in a terminal to get your python version, if you already have it installed 
- You can get the available Python versions at https://www.python.org/downloads/
- next, install opencv version 4.6.0 or update your existing install. To do that, type 'pip install opencv-python' in your terminal window or to update, type 'pip install --upgrade  opencv-python==4.6.0'


## How to run the code?
- clone this repository or download it as a zip-file
- open the repository in an IDE of your choice (Visual Studio Code is recommended)
- Be sure you have all requierd installs done (->What to install?)
- Lastly run the code by clicking the run-button, in VS Code you can find a small play button on the top right if you have the 'convolution-demo.py' file open in the editor
- The logs in the console will guide you through the required steps
