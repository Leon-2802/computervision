# Assignment #4 - Image retrieval by Leon Gobbert and Nils Bergmann 
## What is the project about?

The  aim of the project is to implement an image mosaic. An image mosaic consists of multiple small images arranged in a way that it looks like a given picture. To do so the algorithm is going stepwise through a given picture and searches for its best match (in data). Additionally we check every image to prevent same images to show up next to each other.


## What to install?
- Python version 3.10 is required in order to run the code, type 'python --version' in a terminal to get your python version, if you already have it installed 
- You can get the available Python versions at [https://www.python.org/downloads/]
- next, install opencv version 4.6.0 or update your existing install. To do that, type 'pip install opencv-python' in your terminal window or to update, type 'pip install --upgrade opencv-python==4.6.0'

## How to run the code?
- clone this repository or download it as a zip-file
- open the repository in an IDE of your choice (Visual Studio Code is recommended)
- Choose the right Python interpreter (has to be the right version of Python), in VS Code it is on the bottom right
- Lastly run the code by clicking the run-button, in VS Code you can find a small play button on the top right if you have the 'crate_mosaic.py' file open in the editor
