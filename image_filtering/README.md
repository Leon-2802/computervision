# Image Filtering by Nils Bergmann and Leon Gobbert
## What is the project about?
The aim of the project is to write an image convolution method that only uses numpy and which should give similar results as the OpenCV filter2D method.
The results are shown for visual comparison and will be additionally compared in the code via a mean squared error method. The time required for the
execution of both methods is measured individually and shown as text output in the console.

## What to install?
- Python version 3.10 is required in order to run the code, type 'python --version' in a terminal to get your python version, if you already have it installed 
- You can get the available Python versions at https://www.python.org/downloads/
- next, install opencv version 4.6.0 or update your existing install. To do that, type 'pip install opencv-python' in your terminal window or to update, type 'pip install --upgrade opencv-python==4.6.0'

## How to run the code?
- clone this repository or download it as a zip-file
- open the repository in an IDE of your choice (Visual Studio Code is recommended)
- Choose the right Python interpreter (has to be the right version of Python), in VS Code it is on the bottom right
- Lastly run the code by clicking the run-button, in VS Code you can find a small play button on the top right if you have the 'convolution-demo.py' file open in the editor
